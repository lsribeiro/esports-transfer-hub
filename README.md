# Esports Transfer Hub
This is a responsive web application designed to list information about the transfer moves involving professional esports players (*Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, League of Legends*).
Some of the information provided includes player names and nationality, team logos, transfer status, and news sources.

## Goal
The main goal of building this application is to showcase my **skills** as a web developer, and also to contribute to one of my favorite hobbies: esports.

## The stack
The application uses **Express** for the back end, **React** for the front end and **Mongo** for the database. The app also uses **Bootstrap** and **Material Design** provided by *mdbreact*.

### Current status
The application is currently under development and is not ready for deployment yet.
